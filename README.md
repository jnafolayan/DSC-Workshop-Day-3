Exercise given on the 3rd day of the Developer Student Club

## Assignment

Using NodeJS and the express framework, build a minimal record system. This system should hold the first and last names of random students, along with their ages.

Create an object with 10 students inside. The keys should be the matric numbers of the students (000 - 999), while the values should be objects containing the information about the students as shown in the code below. The table below contains a few students' info your record should hold. Come up with 7 more.

S/N | Matric number | First name | Last name | Age
----|---------------|------------|-----------|----
1   | 001           | Sola       | Adesokan  | 17
2   | 002           | Femi       | Omolaja   | 17
3   | 003           | Obinna     | Ejiofor   | 19

```javascript
	var records = {
		"001": {
			firstName: "Sola",
			lastName: "Adesokan",
			age: 17
		},

		"002": {
			firstName: "Femi",
			lastName: "Omolaja",
			age: 19
		}
		// fill in the rest
	};
```

The API implemented should be capable of doing the following:

**Creating a student's info**
Sample endpoint: _/students/create/001/David/Sanda/12_
Expected result: A new student with name David Sanda, and age 12, has been created.
If the matric number already belongs to a student, user should receive the message, "Matric number already exists".

**Retrieving a student's info**
Sample endpoint: _/students/001_
Expected result: Sola Adesokan - 17 years

Sample endpoint: _/students/001/firstName_
Expected result: Sola

Sample endpoint: _/students/001/lastName_

**Editing a student's info**
Sample endpoint: _/students/edit/001/firstName/Jude_
Expected result: Sola Adesokan has been changed to Jude Adesokan
The endpoint above should change Sola's first name to Jude

Sample endpoint: _/students/edit/001/lastName/King_
Expected result: Sola Adesokan has been changed to Sola King
The endpoint above should change Sola's last name to King

Sample endpoint: _/students/edit/001/age/16_
Expected result: Sola's age has been changed to 16
The endpoint above should change Sola's age to 16

**Deleting a student's info**
Sample endpoint: _/students/delete/001_
Expected result: The student with matric number 001 has been removed.
